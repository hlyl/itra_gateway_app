# IT Risk Assessment (ITRA) - Gateway Questions

A business-friendly Streamlit application for conducting IT Risk Assessments using smart gateway questions that determine assessment scope intelligently.

## 🚀 Quick Start with uv

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed (`pip install uv`)

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone/download the files** into a project directory:
   ```
   your-project/
   ├── itra_gateway_app.py
   ├── pyproject.toml
   └── README.md
   ```

2. **Run the application** (uv will automatically install dependencies):
   ```bash
   uv run streamlit run itra_gateway_app.py
   ```

3. **Access the application** at: `http://localhost:8501`

That's it! uv handles all the dependency management automatically.
